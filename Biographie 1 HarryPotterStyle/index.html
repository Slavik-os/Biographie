         <p class="Movies-Content">
            Late one night, Albus Dumbledore and Minerva McGonagall, professors at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, <br>
            along with the school's groundskeeper, Rubeus Hagrid, deliver a recently orphaned infant named Harry Potter to his <br>
            only remaining relatives, the Dursleys.<br>
            Ten years later, Harry is living a difficult life with the Dursleys. <br>
            After inadvertently causing an incident during a family trip to London Zoo, <br>
            Harry begins receiving unsolicited letters by owls. After he and the Dursleys flee to an island to avoid more letters, <br>
            Hagrid re-appears and informs Harry that he is a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts against the Dursleys' wishes. <br>
            After taking Harry to Diagon Alley to buy his supplies for Hogwarts and a pet owl named Hedwig as a birthday present, <br>
            Hagrid informs him of his past: Harry's parents, James and Lily Potter, died due to a Killing Curse at the hands of the <br>
            malevolent and powerful wizard Lord Voldemort. Harry, the only survivor in the chaos, thus becomes well-known in the wizarding<br>
             world as "The Boy Who Lived".

            pending the summer with the Dursleys, Harry Potter meets Dobby, <br>

            Dobby sabotages an important dinner for the Dursleys, who lock Harry up to prevent his return to Hogwarts. <br>
            Harry's friend Ron Weasley and his brothers Fred and George rescue him in their father's flying Ford Anglia.<br>
            Harry and the Weasley family are joined by Rubeus Hagrid and Hermione Granger at a book-signing by Gilderoy Lockhart, <br>

            Harry Potter has been spending another unhappy summer with the Dursleys. When Aunt Marge Dursley insults his parents,<br>
            he loses his temper and accidentally causes her to inflate like a balloon and float away. Fed up, Harry then flees<br>
            the Dursleys with his broom and trunk. The Knight Bus arrives and takes Harry to the Leaky Cauldron, where he is<br>
            pardoned by Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge for using magic outside of Hogwarts. After reuniting with his best<br>
            friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, Harry learns that Sirius Black, a convicted supporter of the dark wizard<br> 
            Lord Voldemort, has escaped Azkaban prison and intends to kill him.

         <p class="Movies-Content">
            The Order of the Phoenix, a secret organization founded by Albus Dumbledore, informs Harry Potter that the Ministry <br> 
            of Magic is oblivious to Lord Voldemort's return. At the Order's headquarters, Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, mentions <br>
            that Voldemort is after an object he did not have during his previous attack.<br>
            Back at Hogwarts, Harry learns that the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge has appointed a new Defence Against the Dark<br>
             Arts professor: Dolores Umbridge. She and Harry immediately clash, and she punishes Harry for his "lies" by forcing him<br>
              to write a message with a magic quill, scarring his hand. When Ron and Hermione notice Harry's scars, they are outraged,<br>
               but Harry refuses to go to Dumbledore, who has distanced himself from Harry since the summer. As Umbridge's control <br>
               over the school increases, Ron and Hermione aid Harry in forming a secret group to train students in defensive spells,<br>
                calling themselves "Dumbledore's Army". Umbridge recruits the Slytherin students to expose the group. Meanwhile, Harry<br> 
                and Cho Chang develop romantic feelings for each other.
